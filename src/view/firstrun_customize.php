<h3>Customize Your Site</h3>
<p>By creating a config.php file (copy the example file) you can diable pages you don't want and change which contact info people can see</p>
<p>Most important is probably the email settings since that will determine if people can see your email address, see an email form, or don't see any email options at all</p>
